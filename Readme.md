The program you provided is an updated version of the previous program that allows for searching multiple strings in both YAML and non-YAML files. It uses the same approach of walking through the directory tree recursively and checking if each file is a YAML or non-YAML file. If it is a YAML file, it calls a new function findStringInYAML to search for the given strings in the YAML data. If it is not a YAML file, it reads each line of the file and searches for the given strings.

To run the program, you need to pass two or more arguments to the command line. The first argument is the path to the directory you want to search in, and the remaining arguments are the strings you want to search for. Here's an example:
```
go run main.go /path/to/directory instance-type node.kubernetes.io/instance-type
```
This will search for the strings "instance-type" and "node.kubernetes.io/instance-type" in all the YAML and non-YAML files in the directory /path/to/directory.

# Here's a brief description of each function in the program:

main(): The main function of the program that accepts command line arguments, walks through the directory tree, and searches for the given strings in the files.
findStringInYAML(): A recursive function that searches for the given strings in a YAML data structure. If a string is found, it prints the path to the file and the line containing the string.
You can add a README.md file to your project to provide information about your program. Here's an example README file for your program:

# YAML and non-YAML String Searcher
This is a Go program that searches for one or more strings in YAML and non-YAML files in a given directory.

# Prerequisites
To run this program, you need to have Go installed on your system.

# How to use
To use this program, run the following command:
```
go run main.go <path> <search string1> [<search string2> ...]
```
Replace <path> with the path to the directory you want to search in, and <search string1>, <search string2>, etc. with the strings you want to search for. You can search for as many strings as you want.

The program will search for the strings in all the YAML and non-YAML files in the directory and print the path to the file and the line containing the string if a match is found.

Example:
```
go run main.go /path/to/directory instance-type node.kubernetes.io/instance-type
```
This will search for the strings "instance-type" and "node.kubernetes.io/instance-type" in all the YAML and non-YAML files in the directory /path/to/directory.
